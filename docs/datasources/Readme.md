# Datasources

Datasources are one of the main component of Hurry. They provide data hurry as a result to a search query.

The provided results can then be displayed and used to send specific commands through the Menu.

## Module structure

The entrypoint of each Module, as a Datasource is, is a file called `index.js`.

This file must currently be in form of an ES5 Syntax. In some future, ES6 support may be supported if people ask for it.
